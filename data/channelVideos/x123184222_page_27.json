            "description": "(2 Aug 2017) With hundreds of people showing up Wednesday for a chance to pack and ship products to Amazon customers, the e-commerce company made offers to some applicants on the spot. \r\nCody Vike, who applied at Amazon's fulfillment center in Kent, Washington, says he was one of those offered a job. \r\n\"I have a lot friends who work for Amazon and have nothing but good things to say,\" Vike said. \"Pay initially starting out is a little lower than expected but work your way up, put in the hard work and it's going to pay off.\"\r\nAmazon planned to hire thousands of people on the spot. Nearly 40,000 of the 50,000 packing, sorting and shipping jobs at Amazon will be full time. Most of them will count toward Amazon's previously announced goal of adding 100,000 full-time workers by the middle of next year.\r\nThe company is advertising starting wages that range from $11.50 an hour in Chattanooga, Tennessee, to $13.75 an hour in Kent, Washington, near Amazon's Seattle headquarters. The $11.50 rate amounts to about $23,920 a year. In Washington state, the current minimum wage is $11.50 but by 2020 this will increase to $13.50. \r\nBy comparison, the warehouse store operator Costco raised its minimum wage for entry-level workers last year from $13 to $13.50 an hour.\r\nJob applicants lined up at nearly a dozen U.S. warehouses Wednesday. In Romeoville, Illinois, Jharette Vasser said he arrived Wednesday morning about 5 a.m. Within a couple of hours, he said, the parking lot was full of jobs seekers. \r\nMany of the job candidates Wednesday were looking to supplement other income.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/43b225f31af9606f864ca0625d0a41a3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
