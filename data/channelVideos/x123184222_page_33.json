            "description": "(4 Aug 2017) LEADIN:\r\nEgypt has a well-documented battle with the bulge - it has the highest rate of obesity in Africa.\r\nBut a weight loss camp north of Cairo hopes to attract people from across the region who want to get rid of their extra rolls.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThis morning workout pushes the group to their limit and the instructor shows no sign of going easy on them.\r\nBut sweat and tears are all part of the process - these people have chosen to join the class to help them get fit.\r\nCHEFOX is a a fitness and weight loss camp launched in 2014 to help people who are seriously eager to lose weight, stay in shape and change their lifestyle.\r\nIt was started by Nada Ta'lab who visited a weight loss camp in Europe after struggling with obesity for years.\r\n\"I was one of the people who needed complete isolation, needed someone to look after my food, sleeping hours and workouts during the whole 24 hours of the day as well as life couching and nutrition,\" she explains.\r\n\"After that I really wanted to make this model happen inside Egypt and to make Egypt a destination that attracts people from all over the MENA region to get this service instead of travelling abroad.\"\r\nShe explains that the camps are effective because they offer help and support every step of the way.\r\n\"We don't give you a programme and leave you to apply it by yourself. Instead we give you your meal with all the nutrients that you need, we make you play more sports than you would have done on your own.\"\r\nShe also says that being surrounded by people who all have the same goal makes it easier.\r\nOne of the camp members, Mohamed El-ra'ey, thinks this is the key to the success of the camp.\r\n\"We are here all together in a close community sharing the same target and on the same project which is weight loss.\"\r\nLocated 15 miles (24 kilometres) north of Cairo, the camp also offers the chance of complete isolation from temptations.\r\n\"Actually when you are outside there are a lot of temptations, the outings with family or friends are all about food,\" says camp member Rasha el-Sherif, a Jordanian business development manager living in Abu Dhabi.\r\n\"So I found that this is the right environment where there is a lot of support with people like you. You have to eat only what is served and you have to workout as stated in the programme - that's why I liked the idea because its different and you don't have to resist temptations.\"\r\nAside from temptations, Zumba instructor Maggie Balbae says that people also need to gain more confidence in working out.\r\n\"I've always noticed that overweight people are shy and they don't feel like attending classes or going to the gym because they have an image about there bodies and they don't feel comfortable,\" she explains.\r\n\"But here in CHEFOX they help people to break and overcome that image, they motivate people and help them to lose some weight and a percentage of body fat so that people are able to continue what they have started in CHEFOX after they finish the camp.\"\r\nThe global obesity problem now affects 1 in 10 people in the world, it is rising in countries rich and poor, and in many countries it is increasing faster in children than adults, according to a new study from the New England Journal of Medicine.\r\nEgypt has the highest rate of obesity in Africa.\r\nJoining the camp costs around 7,000 Egyptian pounds a week (388 US dollars) and the complete cycle is three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/db2bbe87edcd6e9634e20f22917ef3bb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(4 Aug 2017) A computer law expert on Friday said the arrest by US authorities of the British hacker credited with derailing a global cyberattack earlier this year was \"problematic.\" \r\nTor Ekeland, Managing Partner at Tor Ekeland Law P.C., told the Associated Press that Marcus Hutchins' indictment was very weak and created a climate of distrust towards the US government among the software experts community. \r\nHutchins was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly creating and distributing malicious software designed to collect bank account passwords.\r\nHe was detained in Las Vegas on his way back to Britain from an annual gathering of hackers and information security gurus. \r\nEkeland told British media earlier on Friday that the charges against Hutchins carry a statutory maximum of up to 40 years in jail.\r\nNews of his detention came as a shock to the cybersecurity community. \r\nMany had rallied behind the researcher whose quick thinking helped control the spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack that crippled thousands of computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/10ff9d168ef619b899550f5954d40486 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

We've got a new album that should be done by the end of the year. Won't be out I'm sure by the end of the year, but maybe have a single off of it by the end of the year. So I don't know.

I would throw out stuff and she's like, 'Yeah, I don't like that.' And she would throw out something, and I would say, 'yeah, I don't really like that.' THere's only one where we were like, 'That's pretty cool.' So we've kind pretty much decided at this point.

                "description": "(4 Aug 2017) A computer law expert on Friday said the arrest by US authorities of the British hacker credited with derailing a global cyberattack earlier this year was \"problematic.\" \r\nTor Ekeland, Managing Partner at Tor Ekeland Law P.C., told the Associated Press that Marcus Hutchins' indictment was very weak and created a climate of distrust towards the US government among the software experts community. \r\nHutchins was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly creating and distributing malicious software designed to collect bank account passwords.\r\nHe was detained in Las Vegas on his way back to Britain from an annual gathering of hackers and information security gurus. \r\nEkeland told British media earlier on Friday that the charges against Hutchins carry a statutory maximum of up to 40 years in jail.\r\nNews of his detention came as a shock to the cybersecurity community. \r\nMany had rallied behind the researcher whose quick thinking helped control the spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack that crippled thousands of computers.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/10ff9d168ef619b899550f5954d40486 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

The poem contains the famous words: \"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.\"   \r\nMiller's comments about the poem, \"The Great Colossus,\" by Emma Lazarus, came in defense of President Donald Trump's proposal to dramatically reduce legal immigration and shift the nation toward a system that prioritizes merit and skills over family ties. \r\nMiller noted, correctly, that the poem was not originally on the Statue of Liberty. \r\nBut Lazarus' words have since been widely absorbed in American culture and helped make the statue synonymous with welcoming people from abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/5a4e980fc23be1dcc78de10b356fcc7f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
