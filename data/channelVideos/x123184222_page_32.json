            "description": "(3 Aug 2017) Trinkets, statues and jewelry crafted from the tusks of at least 100 slaughtered elephants were fed Thursday into a rock crusher in Central Park to demonstrate the state's commitment to smashing the illegal ivory trade.\r\nThe artifacts placed ceremoniously onto a conveyor belt to be ground into dust included piles of golf-ball-sized Japanese sculptures, called netsuke, intricately carved into monkeys, rabbits and other fanciful designs. Many of the items were beautiful. Some were extremely valuable.\r\nBut state environmental officials and Wildlife Conservation Society members, who partnered with Tiffany &amp; Co. for the \"Ivory Crush\" of nearly 2 tons (1.8 metric tons) of ivory, said no price justifies slaughtering elephants for their tusks.\r\nThe sale of ivory across international boundaries has been banned since 1990, but the U.S. and many other countries have allowed people to buy and sell ivory domestically, subject to certain regulations that gave smugglers loopholes. Last year, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service instituted a near-total ban on the domestic commercial ivory trade and barred sales across state lines.\r\nSince August 2014, New York law has prohibited the sale, purchase, trade or distribution of anything made from elephant or mammoth ivory or rhinoceros horn, except in limited situations with state approval. Enforcement efforts have focused on New York City, the nation's largest port of entry for illegal wildlife goods, state officials said.\r\nThe ivory pieces sent to the crusher included more than $4.5 million worth seized by undercover investigators from Metropolitan Fine Arts &amp; Antiques in New York City in 2015. In pleading guilty last week to illegally selling ivory, the store's owners agreed to donate $100,000 each to the World Wildlife Fund and Wild Tomorrow Fund for their endangered species protection projects.\r\nMore than 270 tons (245 metric tons) of ivory have been destroyed by governments and conservation groups in high-profile public events in 22 countries, according to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\r\nSome critics have argued that destroying ivory could drive up black market prices by increasing scarcity, thus encouraging more poaching.

            "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington as part of an investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, a person familiar with the probe said Thursday.\r\nThe use of a grand jury, a standard prosecution tool in criminal investigations, suggests that Mueller and his team of investigators are likely to hear from witnesses and demand documents in the coming weeks and months. The person who confirmed to The Associated Press that Mueller had turned to a grand jury was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\r\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the use of a grand jury.\r\nGrand juries are common vehicles to subpoena witnesses and records and to present evidence, though they do not suggest any criminal charges are near or will necessarily be sought. It was not immediately clear how or whether the Washington grand jury was connected to the work of a separate one in Alexandria, Virginia. That panel has been used to gather information on Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser.\r\nA spokesman for Mueller's team did not return an email seeking comment.\r\nMueller's reliance on a grand jury is the \"logical next step in this investigation\" given that it's the traditional method for prosecutors to gather evidence, said Washington defense lawyer Jacob Frenkel.\r\nMeanwhile, lawyers for President Donald Trump said they were unaware of the existence of a grand jury and had no information to suggest the president himself was under federal investigation.\r\n\"With respect to the news of the federal grand jury, I have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation,\" defense attorney John Dowd told the AP.\r\nTy Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn't aware Mueller had started using a new grand jury.\r\n\"Grand jury matters are typically secret,\" Cobb said. \"The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\"\r\nIt was not clear what witnesses might appear before the grand jury or what evidence it might be accumulating or presented with.\r\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May by the Justice Department following the firing by Trump of FBI Director James Comey. He has since assembled a team of more than a dozen investigators, including current and former Justice Department prosecutors with experience in international bribery, organized crime and financial fraud.\r\nThat team has been working at an undisclosed location in Washington, so presenting evidence inside a federal courthouse in the city could be more convenient for the group of investigators than working out of Alexandria. Mueller also worked as a prosecutor in Washington before becoming FBI director, a job he held for 12 years.\r\nA grand jury \"increases the power of the prosecutors,\" said David Levine, law professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law. \"Instead of asking for people to provide testimony, they can demand testimony under the penalty of perjury and under risk of contempt of court. And with respect to documents, instead of asking people for documents, they can demand documents. And so for example the tax returns, a subpoena can unlock those tax returns,\" he said.  \r\nNews of the grand jury came as senators introduced two bipartisan bills aimed at protecting Mueller from being fired by Trump, with both parties signaling resistance to any White House effort to derail the investigation into Russian meddling in last year's election.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/00cb8ccdae6ad860b91259c9d919db02 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(4 Aug 2017) Special Counsel Robert Mueller is using a grand jury in Washington as part of an investigation into potential coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia, a person familiar with the probe said Thursday.\r\nThe use of a grand jury, a standard prosecution tool in criminal investigations, suggests that Mueller and his team of investigators are likely to hear from witnesses and demand documents in the coming weeks and months. The person who confirmed to The Associated Press that Mueller had turned to a grand jury was not authorized to discuss the investigation by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.\r\nThe Wall Street Journal first reported the use of a grand jury.\r\nGrand juries are common vehicles to subpoena witnesses and records and to present evidence, though they do not suggest any criminal charges are near or will necessarily be sought. It was not immediately clear how or whether the Washington grand jury was connected to the work of a separate one in Alexandria, Virginia. That panel has been used to gather information on Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser.\r\nA spokesman for Mueller's team did not return an email seeking comment.\r\nMueller's reliance on a grand jury is the \"logical next step in this investigation\" given that it's the traditional method for prosecutors to gather evidence, said Washington defense lawyer Jacob Frenkel.\r\nMeanwhile, lawyers for President Donald Trump said they were unaware of the existence of a grand jury and had no information to suggest the president himself was under federal investigation.\r\n\"With respect to the news of the federal grand jury, I have no reason to believe that the president is under investigation,\" defense attorney John Dowd told the AP.\r\nTy Cobb, special counsel to the president, said he wasn't aware Mueller had started using a new grand jury.\r\n\"Grand jury matters are typically secret,\" Cobb said. \"The White House favors anything that accelerates the conclusion of his work fairly. ... The White House is committed to fully cooperating with Mr. Mueller.\"\r\nIt was not clear what witnesses might appear before the grand jury or what evidence it might be accumulating or presented with.\r\nMueller was appointed special counsel in May by the Justice Department following the firing by Trump of FBI Director James Comey. He has since assembled a team of more than a dozen investigators, including current and former Justice Department prosecutors with experience in international bribery, organized crime and financial fraud.\r\nThat team has been working at an undisclosed location in Washington, so presenting evidence inside a federal courthouse in the city could be more convenient for the group of investigators than working out of Alexandria. Mueller also worked as a prosecutor in Washington before becoming FBI director, a job he held for 12 years.\r\nA grand jury \"increases the power of the prosecutors,\" said David Levine, law professor at the University of California Hastings College of Law. \"Instead of asking for people to provide testimony, they can demand testimony under the penalty of perjury and under risk of contempt of court. And with respect to documents, instead of asking people for documents, they can demand documents. And so for example the tax returns, a subpoena can unlock those tax returns,\" he said.  \r\nNews of the grand jury came as senators introduced two bipartisan bills aimed at protecting Mueller from being fired by Trump, with both parties signaling resistance to any White House effort to derail the investigation into Russian meddling in last year's election.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3b404f0adeef7cb8dd1b477793dee9fe \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
